Converts the sample csv into a json file.
1. Walk us through the design of your project. Why did you design your project the way you did? What difficulties did you overcome?
The goal of this project was to demonstrate either the ability to access different node modules or the ability to write out the process of converting a csv file into a json file using NodeJS. I felt that, while the process of using csvtojson might be useful, I wanted to take the challenge of writing in a new syntax/environment. Because NodeJS/Javascript in general was so foreign to me, I had a difficult time at first with the approach itself.

2. How did you test your project to verify that it works?
I tried to run it without node_modules initially but found that it doesn't work, so I removed it from .gitignore and placed it into the repo.

3. N/A Hopefully.
